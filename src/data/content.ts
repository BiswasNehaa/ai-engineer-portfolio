A LangGraph agent retrieves relevant chunks, generates a grounded answer with Groq LLaMA 3.3, then hands that answer to an independent verification call. If the verifier flags it unsupported, the graph loops back through a corrective retry — capped at 2 attempts — before returning a final, source-grounded answer via FastAPI.",
